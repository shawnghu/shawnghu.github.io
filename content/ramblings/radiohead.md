Not in any order, but all above a certain threshold of underratedness. No attempt to justify my taste or assertion that the songs are underrated. 
1. Supercollider (from the Basement)
2. Little By Little (from the Basement) (incredibly better than the album version)
3. Feral (from the Basement) (same as above)
4. Videotape (Bonnaroo 2006)
5. I Might Be Wrong (Coachella 2017)
6. Bodysnatchers (Coachella 2017)
7. Lotus Flower (Coachella 2017)
8. Nude ([OKNOTOK version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XITxFtM2N5M))
9. Motion Picture Soundtrack (OKNOTOK version)
10. Jigsaw Falling Into Place (just the ordinary version)
11. Meeting in the Aisle (here particularly because it's obscure. Good ambiance for specific mindsets.)
