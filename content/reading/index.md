[Dan Luu's blog](https://danluu.com/), where he dismantles lazy cached answers that people often present, argues that a bunch of things are actually pretty good, argues that a bunch of things are actually pretty bad, measures some things to an extent I wouldn't bother to do, and sometimes just goes in-depth about things he was interested in. Good technical content.

[Nikhil Suresh's blog](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/), where a guy vehemently vents his frustrations with a mostly non-functional tech industry, grows to pursue positive change in a practical way, and encourages others to do the same.

For books in book-format, here's a link to my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/176465819-shawn-hu). It's not at all comprehensive, but it's where I've cared to write about books I've read. I will single out a couple of books below for having a disproportionate impact on me:

*Ender's Game*, which was the first work I read where the characters seemed to be thinking realistically and intelligently in a situation with significant moral stakes, and which contained such raw human and emotional elements. It probably helped that the characters were systematically-underestimated child geniuses. The followup book *Speaker for the Dead* was also important to my development as a person as an example of radical empathy and responsibility, and the [less-popular](https://xkcd.com/304/) *Xenocide* helped me with a religious struggle when I first read it. Having talked to others, these books filled for me a role that probably HPMoR did for them.

[*Inadequate Equilibria*](https://equilibriabook.com/): I spent a lot of my life suffering under various delusions of market efficiency, but I never had a good conversation that could break down the concept for me; arguably I didn't try to ask anyone with an adequately nuanced notion of what market efficiency was in the first place. A lot of the pieces were already in place for me, e.g, I knew about Nash equilibiria and could observe that the world seemed to be much worse than I'd expect in some places, but I didn't connect these ideas and had no model for where to expect suboptimality or what mechanistic analysis I could apply to it. Sometimes, a painstakingly thorough elaboration of an idea from premises to conclusions is actually exactly what someone needs. (To this day I still systemically don't seem to appreciate just how much low-hanging fruit there is for a human being to try to pick in improving the world. It's something I'm working on.)

Other single pieces of work that I have a special appreciation for:


- [How much do you believe your results?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nnDTgmzRrzDMiPF9B/how-much-do-you-believe-your-results) on LW: This is the kind of thing I wish I had a primer for earlier, and is just generally presented in an intriguing format, good for teaching me.
