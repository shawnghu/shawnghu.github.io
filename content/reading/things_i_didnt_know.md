title: "Things I didn't know (in math)"
date: 2025-03-10
summary: "As mentioned elsewhere I got a BS in math and an MS in CS without knowing a bunch of completely elementary things. These are some of them."

This list is meant to grow over time, mostly as ideas come to mind.

### Complex numbers
- How these things generally work; most of their analytic and geometric properties. (I was pretty comfortable with their algebraic ones.) (Somehow I got an A in a class on complex analysis. I'm not sure I ever understood the Cauchy-Riemann equations.)


### Trigonometry
- The sum of two sinusoids which have the same frequency is a sinusoid. (I suppose I had a basic intuition for this, noting that the sum has to satisfy some of the same properties, namely it will be the negative of its 2nd derivative and it will have the same period.)
    - The fact that you can prove this with the angle sum formulas, e.g, take sin(A + B) = sinAcosB + cosAsinB, then interpret the sinA and cosA terms as coefficients, so that any linear combination of cosB and sinB is a rescaling of sin(A + B) and is therefore a sinusoid.

- Relationship to $e^{ix}$

### Linear algebra
- How least-squares approximation works, or where the normal equations come from. (I got an A in a convex optimization class, a mathematical statistics class, and a machine learning class...)
- Everything having to do with adjoints, inner products, and symmetric matrices.

### Analysis
- The implicit and inverse function theorems (I passed a graduate class in differential topology, though admittedly the professor might have taken some pity on me for this one).
